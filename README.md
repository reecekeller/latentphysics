Physics-Informed Learning of Latent Dynamics

This repo implements a physics-informed optimization based procedure to learn dynamical systems in symbolic form from neural data. Specifically, the model learns implicit differentials rather than explicit functions (unlike symbolic regression), thereby focusing the learning on constraints on the system rather than state dynamics.
